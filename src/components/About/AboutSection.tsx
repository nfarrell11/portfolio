                I&apos;m an interdisciplinary artist, application developer, and technical project leader with a decade of experience supporting major cultural institutions across Vancouver. My career has been built behind the scenes: coordinating exhibition installs, managing climate-controlled storage, and overseeing the safe transport of high-value artworks. I understand how to embrace change, meet deadlines under pressure, and build trust with clients from day one.

                Today, I bring that same precision and systems thinking to software. I build web applications that solve real-world problems for small teams and service-based industries. My development approach emphasizes accessibility, responsive design, clean architecture, and customer-first thinking &mdash; always focused on tools that are intuitive to use, easy to maintain, and ready to scale.
